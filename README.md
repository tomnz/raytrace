# Raytrace #

Basic raytracer that draws a scene containing a plane and several spheres. The scene can be altered in code. Rays are traced in a threaded fashion to take full advantage of multiple cores. Contains some interesting features, such as stochastic sampling to achieve simple antialiasing.
